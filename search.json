Demonstrates methods of exploring, organizing, and presenting data, and introduces fundamentals of probability, including probability distributions and conditional probability, with applications to 2x2 tables. Presents the foundations of statistical inference, including concepts of population, sample parameter, and estimate; and approaches to inferences using the likelihood function, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests. Introduces and employs the statistical computing package, STATA or R, to manipulate data and prepare students for remaining course work in this sequence.\n\n\nCausal Inference in Medicine and Public Health I\nTeaching Assistant, Spring 2022 and Spring 2023\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\nInstructor: Dr. Elizabeth Stuart\nCourse description: Presents an overview of methods for estimating causal effects: how to answer the question of “What is the effect of A on B?” Includes discussion of randomized designs, but with more emphasis on alternative designs for when randomization is infeasible: matching methods, propensity scores, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables. Motivates methods by examples from the health sciences, particularly mental health and community or school-level interventions."

Students will learn tools and techniques for problem solving, decision-making, conflict resolution, task management, communications, and goal alignment in team settings. They will also learn how to measure team dynamics and performance, and assess methods for building and sustaining high-performance teams. Students will also explore their own leadership, personality and cognitive styles and learn how these may affect their performance in a team. The course will focus on team-based experiential projects and exercises as well as provide opportunities to individually reflect and write about the concepts explored and skills gained throughout the course."
