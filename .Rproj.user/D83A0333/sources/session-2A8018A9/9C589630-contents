Hi! My name is Carly Lupton Brantner (recently Carly Lupton-Smith), and I am a third year Biostatistics PhD Student at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I work with Dr. Elizabeth Stuart in causal inference methods applied to mental health questions, and I specifically am focusing my dissertation research on combining multiple datasets to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects.
